      <h2> What is KCON?</h2> 
      <p>KCON is the world’s largest fan celebration of Korean culture and music. We launched our flagship Los Angeles event in 2012 and have since 
        expanded to New York, Tokyo, Bangkok, Abu Dhabi, and more welcoming over 1 MILLION fans.

        No matter where in the world we are, our greatest honor is to spark the light of hallyu within you, our fans.
        
        Through KCON, we invite you to explore K-Pop, K-Beauty, K-Food and beyond through star-studded concerts, engaging panels, 
        an expo overflowing with innovative products (and idol appearances!), KCON-exclusive programs, and of course our artist engagements–your chance to meet and even hi-touch your favorite K-Pop stars. </p>
